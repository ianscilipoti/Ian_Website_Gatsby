Since 2013, I have maintained an online business selling special effects through the Unity3D asset store. My work consists of packs of effects of various catagories. Below I will outline the work currently available on the Asset Store.  


Fire Pack
-------

The fire pack is my earliest and most popular asset. The pack utilizes meticulously sourced animations from real footage alongside carefully configured particle systems. By using a combination of real footage and particles, the pack maintains visual complexity while not suffering from overly repetitive animation.

Northern Lights

The northern lights pack captures the visual phenomenon seen in northern regions of the world. The effects use particles and meshes with custom shaders to mimic the real volumetric light show. Special care was taken to ensure the effects looked just as good in a time lapse setting.

The VR terrain sculpting project was the senior thesis of my undergraduate education. The project consisted of building two models for VR terrain sculpting, then comparing them with a user study. The goal was to see which of the two models would be more intuitive for new users. After the months of hard work, the project was awarded best thesis of the computer science department for the academic year.

Model 1: Sandbox

The first of the two models I developed was made with sandboxes in mind. Given many people have played in sandboxes as children, it crossed my mind that to harness that experience could lead to intuitive user control.  -->
